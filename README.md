//As a user, I want to see the bingo card clearly.

//As a user, I want to see different colors for the stamps.

//As a user, I need to cover the numbers easily without any lag.

//As a user, I am expecting to get a number from each group.

//As a user, I should be able to cross off numbers so I can match the numbers.





//pseudocode

//it's made of set of number 1-30 (add intializenumber as an array so i can call the numbers,
// generateplayercard()creates the sets of the number,
// callrandomnumber()array picks and remove the numbers,
// findnumber() array so checks if the numbers is correct,
// marknumber() array to find the numbers on the cards )



//the user should get at least one number if each set which is 1-10,11-20,21-30 (I have to use if else statement and should be arrays)



//the user get 15seconds only to choose the numbers (I hAVE TO use SetTimeout(gamesover,15sec)function should be added as gameover or document.getelementById())


//the user should get the four corners to win (I need to add else if statement for checking and i need to add a function that if else will be inside the function I should call it checkFor win)
